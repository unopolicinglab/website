abstract: "**Purpose**: This study examined the effects of crime severity and relational distance on bystanders' willingness to report crime and provide a statement to police. **Methods**: A sample of 1438 adults in the U.S. completed a factorial vignette survey. Participants read three crime scenarios and indicated their willingness to report and provide a statement to police. Crime severity (major harm or minor harm), bystander relationship to the perpetrator (family member, friend, or stranger), and bystander relationship to the victim (family member, friend, or stranger) were manipulated across scenarios. Multilevel models were estimated. **Results**: Crime severity increased the willingness to report, whereas a close relationship with the perpetrator decreased it. However, a close relationship with the victim attenuated the effect of relational distance to the perpetrator on the willingness to report. Crime severity and relational distance did not influence the willingness to provide a statement, with one exception. **Conclusions**: Crime severity and relational distance influence bystanders' willingness to report, but do not appear to influence the willingness to provide a statement. The willingness to report and provide a statement are related, but may be distinct dimensions of the willingness to cooperate."
