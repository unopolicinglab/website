abstract: "Despite considerable attention to gun violence, crime gun investigations
have received limited empirical focus. Research suggests
that reliance on specialized investigators and long periods of time
between gun crimes, evidence collection, and evidence processing
are barriers to timely intelligence. The Phoenix Police
Department Crime Gun Liaison Program (CGLP) intended to close
this gap by increasing the capacity of patrol officers to investigate
gun-related offenses. To examine the impact of the CGLP, a
randomized control trial was used to select 16 treatment and 16
matched control officers. We supplement quantitative analyses
with qualitative results from focus groups. Treatment officers
were referred to and responded to significantly more firearmrelated
incidents, which resulted in collecting significantly more
casings, firearms, fingerprints, and DNA samples during the sixmonth
study period than control officers. Treatment officers also
generated a significantly higher number of NIBIN leads and
arrests. However, incident-level analyses provided less consistent
results, though incidents involving treatment officers remained
more likely to result in arrest. Qualitative results support these
findings, with officers finding value in the program and reporting
improved ability to respond to gun crime and reduced time spent
processing scenes. Leveraging patrol officers can improve police
agency capacity for responding to gun violence."
