# Abstract
abstract = "**Purpose**: There has been growing interest from legislators and civil rights groups to identify subgroups within law enforcement agencies. Yet, few studies have examined the attributes and behaviors of officers recruited to join. This study adopts a network approach to understanding the scope and social position of officers invited to join departmental subgroups. **Methods**: We surveyed 1352 officers in one large department to examine the attributes, workplace behaviors, and networks of officers invited to join subgroups. Specifically, we used network analytic techniques to identify whether officers invited to join held more influential structural positions than their non-invited peers in the department. **Results**: Nine percent of officers were invited to join a subgroup. One-third received an invitation within the past year, and over half noted that these subgroups had an online presence. While results found no significant differences in the attributes and behaviors of invited and non-invited officers, officers invited to join were likely to be embedded in more cohesive friendship networks. **Conclusions**: Regardless of their primary purpose, subgroup membership may pose operational and organizational challenges in police departments. Our study provides insight into the implications of entry and the role of peers in fostering these opportunities."
