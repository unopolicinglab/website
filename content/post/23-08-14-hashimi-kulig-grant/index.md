A new effort led by researchers at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) seeks to provide an overview of labor trafficking in Nebraska and provide actionable items on how the state can improve identification and responses. The two-year project began in July and is funded by a roughly **$500k** grant from the Howard G. Buffett Foundation.

The project is led by [Teresa Kulig](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/criminology-and-criminal-justice/about-us/teresa-kulig.php) and Sadaf Hashimi, assistant professors in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at UNO. Kulig noted that the goal of this project is to provide an assessment of how these offenses are carried out and the challenges in detecting and responding to these crimes.

“Although some research on labor trafficking exists, very little is known about these crimes, including the harms victims experience, pathways of exploitation, and the ongoing challenges that victims face once they are identified,” Kulig said. “Thanks to the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, we now have the resources to examine labor trafficking in our state and lay the foundation for future work in this area.”

Through collaboration with stakeholders and the use of grant funds, Kulig and Hashimi’s research will contribute to the understanding of labor trafficking in the state and how to improve responses (e.g., law enforcement responses, community and legal services). The project’s findings and recommendations will serve as a valuable resource for individuals and organizations dedicated to combating human trafficking.
