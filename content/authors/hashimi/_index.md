Dr. Hashimi’s research centers on issues pertaining to policing and policy, peer influence and crime, desistance from crime, and violence prevention and intervention efforts. Specifically, her current projects aim to understand: 1) the police role, including how the structure and composition of informal and formal officer networks contribute to departmental culture, officer wellbeing, and officer performance (i.e., police use of force, excessive use of force, misconduct), and 2) prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing at-risk behaviors, including criminal group involvement, firearm use, and criminal recidivism. Her research has been funded by the Department of Homeland Security, Public Safety Canada, the National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research, New Jersey’s Gun Violence Research Center and has appeared in outlets including the *Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency*, *Justice Quarterly*, *Criminology & Public Policy*, *Policing: An International Journal* and *Methodolgical Innovations*.
