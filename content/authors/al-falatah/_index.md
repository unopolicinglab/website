Hi I'm Sarah Al Falatah! I recently graduated from the University of South Florida with a B.S. in Biomedical Sciences. Currently, I am studying to get my MA in Criminology at the University of Nebraska Omaha. I am most passionate about mental health research. I am excited to expand my skills as a researcher and advance in my academic career.
