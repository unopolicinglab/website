Rachael Rief is a doctoral student in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha. She currently works as a research assistant at the [National Institute of Justice](https://nij.ojp.gov/bio/rachael-rief). Her research focuses on women in policing, police culture, occupational outcomes, and officer well-being. Among other topics, she has examined the role of gender in individuals' decisions to enter the field and the effect of officersâ€™ perceived fit in their work environment on outcomes like interactions with co-workers, tenure, and stress. Her work has appeared in *Police Quarterly*, *Feminist Criminology*, *Criminal Justice & Behavior*, *Policing: An International Journal*, and *Police Chief Magazine*.
