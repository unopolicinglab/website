My name is Seth Goldsmith and I am a current Criminology and Criminal Justice graduate student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. My research interests pertain to the psychology behind criminal behavior, the underlying societal issues behind crime, and patterns of violence. I am also interested in mental illness, serial killing, and school shootings. I received my bachelor's degree in Criminology & Criminal Justice (with a minor in psychology) from UNL in the Spring of 2025. I am now on track to receive my MA in Criminology and Criminal Justice in 2027 from UNO.
