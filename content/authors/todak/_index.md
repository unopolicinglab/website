She has a Ph.D. in Criminology and Criminal Justice from Arizona State University (ASU) and is currently pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Mixed Research Methods from UAB. She uses qualitative and mixed methods to study critical issues in policing. Her current work is focused on police diversity, culture, misconduct, and whistleblowing.
