The VIPR Lab will be at the American Society of Criminology's annual meeting this year in D.C. The project we'll be presenting is called "Challenging Police Killings Data" where we compare official incident level officer involved shooting data to unofficial sources like the Gun Violence Archive.

The presentation will be on Wednesday the 12th at 3:30 at Archives-M4. It will feature [Dr. Justin Nix](https://www.viprlab.org/author/justin-nix/), [Dr. Sadaf Hashimi](https://www.viprlab.org/author/sadaf-hashimi/), Master's students [Jordan Cline](https://www.viprlab.org/author/colton-tinsley/) and [Colton Tinsley](https://www.viprlab.org/author/jordan-cline/), and alumna [Loganne Ditter](https://www.viprlab.org/author/loganne-ditter/).
