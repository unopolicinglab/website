The VIPR Lab will be at the American Society of Criminology's annual meeting this year in Washington, D.C. Our presentation is called "Challenging Police Killings Data" where we compare official incident-level officer-involved shooting data to unofficial sources like the Gun Violence Archive. The presentation will be on Wednesday the 12th at 3:30 at Archives-M4. It will feature [Dr. Justin Nix](https://www.viprlab.org/author/justin-nix/), [Dr. Sadaf Hashimi](https://www.viprlab.org/author/sadaf-hashimi/), Master's students [Jordan Cline](https://www.viprlab.org/author/jordan-cline/) and [Colton Tinsley](https://www.viprlab.org/author/colton-tinsley/), and alumna [Loganne Ditter](https://www.viprlab.org/author/loganne-ditter/).

Dr. Nix has another presentation on the 12th, where he and his coauthors will discuss the predictors, processes, and outcomes of victim notification in the Minnesota Sexual Assault Kit Initiative (9:30 in Independence Salon H-M4). 

Dr. Hashimi is participating in some other panels, as well. In one she will cover innovations in human trafficking research (Friday at 2:00 in Independence Salon H-M4) and the other on identifying subgroups within police departments (Thursday at 12:30 in Independence Salon G-M4). All sessions involving Drs. Nix and Hashimi will feature other UNO and VIPR Lab faculty, alums, and affiliates.

Our students are also presenting some of their own work! See Jordan Cline present his spatiotemporal analysis of bicycle thefts with [Dr. Ling Ren](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/criminology-and-criminal-justice/about-us/ling-ren.php) on Wednesday at 2:00 in Independence Salon F-M4. At the same time in Supreme Court-M4, Colton Tinsley will be presenting his work done with [Dr. Jessica Deitzer](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/criminology-and-criminal-justice/about-us/jessica-deitzer.php) on the links between social isolation and violent tendencies.

We hope to see you there!
