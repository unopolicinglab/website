We were a busy group at ASC this year, but we remembered to snap a few pictures at our second annual VIPR Lab Panel. 

First up, Natalie shared some preliminary results from our [DHS-funded survey](https://www.viprlab.org/post/21-11-23-dhs-insider-threats/) about screening practices:

Next, Sarah presented results from her [thesis](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2863205902?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true) on attempted suicides in Omaha before and after the onset of COVID-19:

Brenna then talked about her and Dr. Huff's [evaluation](https://www.viprlab.org/publication/huff_dunlap_2023/) of Year 2 of Omaha's restorative justice diversion program:

And last but not least, Trey shared findings from an NIJ-funded [project](https://jnix.netlify.app/project/nij-empathic-accuracy/) dealing with emotional intelligence in policing:

Brenna also helped administer a survey to members of the Division of Experimental Criminology. Here she is sharing the results:
