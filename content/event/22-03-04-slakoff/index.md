[Dr. Danielle Slakoff](https://daniellecslakoff.weebly.com/) is an Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at Sacramento State University. Her research is focused on the media portrayal of women and girls as victims of crime, with a particular focus on how race/ethnicity may impact these portrayals. She has published on the Missing White Woman Syndrome, and has also examined how White, Black, and Latina women and girls are differentially portrayed in news stories about their victimization. Her other areas of expertise include intimate partner violence, true crime, and LGBTQ+ issues. Dr. Slakoff's research and/or commentary has been featured on several local and national media platforms, including on the nationally-syndicated Tamron Hall Show, The New York Times, The Washington Post, NPR's Baltimore station, Politifact, Insider, Deseret News, KNX1070 News Radio (Los Angeles), and three local Sacramento television stations (ABC 10, Fox 40, & KCRA/NBC 3).
