# VIPR Lab Members Configuration
# 
# Add lab members whose publications should be automatically synced from ORCID.
# When multiple lab members co-author a paper, it will only appear once (deduplicated by DOI).

# This allows their names to link properly when they co-author with lab members
author_mappings: {}
  # Add external collaborators who have author pages on your site
  # Format: "Full Name in ORCID": "author-slug"
  # Example:
  # "Jessie Huff": "huff"
  # "Marie Ouellet": "ouellet"

# Options: "firstauthor-year", "firstauthor-et-al-year", "firstauthor-shortname-year"

# How to handle co-authored papers with multiple lab members
# "first-author" - use the first author's name in the slug
# "all-lab-members" - include all lab member names (can get long)
coauthor_handling: "first-author"

# Maximum slug length (to avoid very long folder names)
max_slug_length: 60
