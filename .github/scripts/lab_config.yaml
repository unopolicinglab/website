# VIPR Lab Members Configuration
# 
# Add lab members whose publications should be automatically synced from ORCID.
# When multiple lab members co-author a paper, it will only appear once (deduplicated by DOI).

# "first-author" - use the first author's name in the slug
# "all-lab-members" - include all lab member names (can get long)
coauthor_handling: "first-author"

# Maximum slug length (to avoid very long folder names)
max_slug_length: 60
